WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP design_2_i/multiplier_proj_0/U0/multiplier_proj_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/multiplier_0/p_reg multiplier stage design_2_i/multiplier_proj_0/U0/multiplier_proj_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/multiplier_0/p_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
